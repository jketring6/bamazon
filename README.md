# BAM-azon!

BAM-azon is a Terminal/Bash Node.js based app that simulates an Amazon-like shopping experience. This app takes in orders from customers and will keep track of the current stock that the store has as customers make their orders.

## Getting Started

Begin by installing dependencies:

```
npm install
```

In your Terminal/Bash, type the following to open the app:

```
node customer.js
```

Once the app is open, feel free to browse the inventory and follow the Inquirer Prompts to make purchases.
